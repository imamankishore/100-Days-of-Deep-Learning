## 🚀 Why This Challenge?

Deep Learning is the foundation of modern Artificial Intelligence. From computer vision to natural language processing, deep learning models have transformed how machines understand data. This repository captures my consistent effort over 100 days to:

- Understand core deep learning concepts from scratch
- Build models using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Explore and implement neural network architectures
- Solve real-world problems using deep learning

---

## 🎯 Goals

- 📘 Learn theory and math behind neural networks
- 💻 Implement models from scratch and using libraries
- 🧪 Experiment with datasets and optimization techniques
- 📊 Document daily progress, code, and key takeaways
- 🧠 Build a strong DL project portfolio
